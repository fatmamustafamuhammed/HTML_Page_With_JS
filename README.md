# Create HTML Page With JS

This project demonstrates how to dynamically generate user profile cards on a web page using JavaScript. 
Each card displays a user's name, age, and profile image.

## Features
- Dynamically creates user cards with name, age, and image
- Uses vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- visually styled cards

## How It Works
- The `main.js` script creates a container and adds user cards for each person in the `names` and `ages` arrays.
- Each card includes a name, age, and a profile image (`images/user.png`).
- The cards are styled for clarity and visual appeal.
